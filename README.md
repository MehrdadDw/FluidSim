## Prerequisites
- SFML library installed.
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
- Make (for building the project).

0. prerequisites:
   ```bash
   # linux
   sudo apt install libsfml-dev
   
   # mac
   brew install sfml

Build and Run the simulation by:
   ```bash
mkdir build && cd build

cmake ..
cmake --build .

./fluid_sim

   ```
